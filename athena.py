This project is a collaborative effort to automate the operations of
the FIOC UK Battle Watch. This desktop application is a feature-rich
tool suite that intelligently tracks user activity, provides efficient
report dissemination functions, and allows for visually-aided vessel
tracking. If you are interested in viewing this project, please access
GitLab from any NSANET position, where you can find this repository
under 'jbjulia/athena'. At this time, Athena is currently being
reviewed for transfer, and will soon be accessible from NIPRNET for
demonstration purposes only. For more information, please contact me at
jbjulia@nsa.ic.gov, or joseph.b.julian@gmail.com for non-NSA interest.
